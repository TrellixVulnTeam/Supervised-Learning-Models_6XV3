# 2_perceptron

Implementation of a single layer perceptron.

# 2_adalineGD

Implementation of a single layer Adaptive Linear Neuron via a gradient descent algorithm. Convergence is checked without and with a standardization.
    
# 2_adalineSGD

Implementation of a single layer Adaptive Linear Neuron via a stochastic gradient descent algorithm. A standardization is applied.

# 13_netinputTF

Implementation of a net input z of a sample point x in a one dimensional dataset with weights w and bias b via low
    level TensorFlow API.
    
# 13_arrayTF

Creation of a simple rank-3 tensor of size batchsize x2 x3, reshaping of it, and calculation of the column sums and mean via low level TensorFlow API.
