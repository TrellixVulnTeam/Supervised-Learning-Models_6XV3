# Content of the programs:

## 02_perceptron

Implementation of a single layer perceptron:
1. Design the perceptron
2. Prepare the data
3. Train the perceptron
4. Visualize the decision boundaries and verify that the training sample is classified correctly. 

## 2_adalineGD

Implementation of a single layer Adaptive Linear Neuron via a gradient descent algorithm. Convergence is checked without and with a standardization.
    
## 2_adalineSGD

Implementation of a single layer Adaptive Linear Neuron via a stochastic gradient descent algorithm. A standardization is applied.

## 13_netinputTF

Implementation of a net input z of a sample point x in a one dimensional dataset with weights w and bias b via low
    level TensorFlow API.
    
## 13_arrayTF

Creation of a simple rank-3 tensor of size batchsize x2 x3, reshaping of it, and calculation of the column sums and mean via low level TensorFlow API.
